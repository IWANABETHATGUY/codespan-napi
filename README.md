## Ability

### Build

After `yarn build/npm run build` command, you can see `package-template.[darwin|win32|linux].node` file in project root. This is the native addon built from [lib.rs](./src/lib.rs).

### Test

With [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava), run `yarn test/npm run test` to testing native addon. You can also switch to another testing framework if you want.

## Develop requirements

- Install latest `Rust`
- Install `Node.js@10+` which fully supported `Node-API`
- Install `yarn@1.x`

## Test in local

- yarn
- yarn build
- yarn test

And you will see:

```bash
$ ava --verbose

  ✔ sync function from native code
  ✔ sleep function from native code (201ms)
